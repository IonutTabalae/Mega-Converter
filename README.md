## Built with Flutter

MegaConverter is built using Flutter, Google's UI toolkit for crafting beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. This cross-platform framework allows for code reusability and faster development cycles. Flutter's rich set of widgets and extensive capabilities have been leveraged to create this high-performance application.

Flutter's benefits include:

- **Fast Development**: Hot Reload allows you to experiment, build UIs, add features, and fix bugs faster.
- **Expressive and Flexible UI**: Quickly ship features with a focus on native end-user experiences.
- **Native Performance**: Flutterâ€™s widgets incorporate all critical platform differences such as scrolling, navigation, icons and fonts to provide full native performance on both iOS and Android.

## Design

The application boasts a user-centric design that is intuitive and easy to navigate. Each conversion category has its own dedicated page, enhancing the organization and accessibility of the application. The design also incorporates modern UI/UX principles to provide a visually appealing and interactive user experience.
